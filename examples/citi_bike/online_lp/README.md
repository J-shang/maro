# Performance

Below are the final environment metrics of the onlineLP in different topologies.
For each experiment, we setup the environment and test for a duration of 1 week.
Besides the parameter listed in the table, the experiment is configured with the
default parameter value in the file `examples/citi_bike/online_lp/config.yml`
